  <h1> IoRT Official Guidelines</h1>

  <div class="content">
    <h2>Core Members and Trainees</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The club currently has 6 core members, with all other participants designated as trainees.</li>
      <li>Trainees are required to collaborate with core members on upcoming projects. Core members will provide leadership and guidance to trainees.</li>
      <li>In teams with more than one core member, they must collectively decide who will take the lead. The leadership role must be agreed upon before project initiation.</li>
      <li>If a team does not have a core member, trainees must step up and take responsibility for leadership within that team.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Team Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>All members must collaborate closely with their team and other teams, ensuring smooth communication and project execution.</li>
      <li>Every team member must contribute actively to the team’s goals and objectives.</li>
      <li>Even if you are in a leadership position, ensure that every member has a voice and is able to contribute to the decision-making process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ROS 2 Collaboration</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Since all individual development efforts will eventually be integrated as ROS 2 nodes, collaboration is essential for achieving the club’s objectives.</li>
      <li>Each team’s work should be modular, well-documented, and align with the final ROS 2-based system.</li>
      <li>Ensure your code and contributions are pushed regularly to the project repository, maintaining clean version control practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>General Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Respect deadlines: timely completion of assigned tasks is critical for overall project success.</li>
      <li>Communicate openly: always update the team on progress or challenges faced. It is better to ask for help early rather than delay the entire team.</li>
      <li>Be accountable: take ownership of your assigned roles and responsibilities.</li>
      <li>Maintain professional and respectful behavior in all interactions with other team members.</li>
      <li>Regular meetings should be conducted to discuss project status and future planning. Attendance and participation in these meetings are mandatory.</li>
      <li>Document your work: All development efforts should be well-documented to allow smooth handovers and future work by other members.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>As a member of Intel IoT Club, your contributions are crucial to the success of each project. We encourage all members to collaborate, share knowledge, and adhere to these guidelines to foster a productive and innovative environment.</p>
